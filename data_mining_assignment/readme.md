# Data Mining Assignment

This repository contains all source files, datasets, and implementations developed as part of the **Data Mining** course assignment.  
The project covers various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and outlier detection techniques — all implemented using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates practical applications of **data mining techniques** through hands-on experiments.  
Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm or analysis process, including:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization of results (accuracy, confusion matrix, clustering plots, etc.)  
- Comparison of performance across algorithms
